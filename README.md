# Open 3D Engine Networking Special Interest Group

Materials for the Open 3D Engine Foundation Networking Special Interest Group (O3DE Network SIG).
We manage the networking components including foundational pieces, transport, Multiplayer, client/server interactions and Cloud connectivity pieces of O3DE.

### Who can Attend or Participate?

O3DE cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the project. The #sig-network channel on O3DE Discord is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the GitHub Discussions area which need your input.
